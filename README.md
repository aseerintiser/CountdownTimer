# Countdown Timer
This is a simple countdown timer, which shows the remaining time in minutes and seconds.  
It will have a start/pause button and a reset button which is only visible, if the timer is not running.  
On the screen rotation of device, or closing the app through the back button, or by swiping it off the recent apps list,  
it keeps running seamlessly.
